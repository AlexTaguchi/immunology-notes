Notes on how the human immune system works

*Reference: https://www.microbiologybook.org/*

### Introduction
Immunology is the study of our protection from foreign macromolecules or invading organisms and our responses to them. These invaders include viruses, bacteria, protozoa or even larger parasites. In addition, we develop immune responses against our own proteins (and other molecules) in autoimmunity and against our own aberrant cells in tumor immunity. The main function and challenge of the immune system is properly discriminating between what is self and foreign.

### Innate or non-specific immunity
The innate immune system is our first line of defense against invading organisms. It comes in two flavors, anatomical and humoral barriers to infection:
- Anatomical barriers:
  - Skin: The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier nearly impermeable to most infectious agents. Desquamation (skin peeling) also helps remove adhered bacteria and other infectious agents.
  - Tears, saliva, sweat: Liquid flushing helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth. Contain enzymes and anti-microbial peptides that inhibit bacterial growth.
  - Mucus: Lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract helps protect the lungs and digestive systems from infection
- Humoral barriers:
  - Complement system: Major humoral non-specific defense mechanism. Increased vascular permeability, recruitment of phagocytic cells, and lysis and opsonization (targeting for destruction) of bacteria.
  - Coagulation system: Blood clotting in case of physical damage to the area.
  - Lactoferrin and transferrin: By binding iron, an essential nutrient for bacteria, these proteins limit bacterial growth.
  - Interferons: Interferons are proteins that can limit virus replication in cells.
  - Lysozyme: Lysozyme breaks down the cell wall of bacteria.
  - Interleukin-1: Il-1 induces fever and the production of acute phase proteins, some of which are antimicrobial because they can opsonize bacteria.

### Cell types and roles

| Cell | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Phagocytic cells | Phagocytosis and intracellular killing |
| NK cells and K-cell | Direct and antibody dependent cytolysis |
| LAK | IL2-activated cytolysis|
| Lactoferrin and Transferrin	| Iron binding |
| Interferons	| Antiviral proteins |
| TNF-alpha	| Antiviral, phagocyte activation |
| Lysozyme	| Peptidoglycan hydrolysis |
| Fibronectin	| Opsonization and phagocytosis |
