### Introduction
Immunology is the study of our protection from foreign macromolecules or invading organisms and our responses to them. These invaders include viruses, bacteria, protozoa or even larger parasites. In addition, we develop immune responses against our own proteins (and other molecules) in autoimmunity and against our own aberrant cells in tumor immunity. The main function and challenge of the immune system is properly discriminating between what is self and what is foreign.

### Innate/Non-Specific Immunity
The innate immune system forms the first (anatomical) and second (humoral) lines of defense against invading organisms:
- **1<sup>st</sup>** line of defense - Anatomical barriers:
  - Skin: The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier nearly impermeable to most infectious agents. Desquamation (skin peeling) also helps remove adhered bacteria and other infectious agents.
  - Tears, saliva, sweat: Liquid flushing helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth. Contain enzymes and anti-microbial peptides that inhibit bacterial growth.
  - Mucus: Lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract helps protect the lungs and digestive systems from infection
- **2<sup>nd</sup>** line of defense - Humoral (body fluid) barriers:
  - Complement system: Major humoral non-specific defense mechanism. Increased vascular permeability, recruitment of phagocytic cells, and lysis and opsonization (targeting for destruction) of bacteria. It is a group of proteins in blood plasma that results in lysis of microbial or foreign cells through a cascade of events.
  - Coagulation: Blood clotting in case of physical damage to the area.
  - Inflammation: White blood cell mediated increase in blood flow to the area of injury or infection, causing redness and warmth. Leak of fluids into tissues may result in swelling.
  - Lactoferrin and transferrin: Bind iron, an essential nutrient for bacteria, to limit bacterial growth.
  - Interferons: Limit virus replication in cells.
  - Lysozyme: Breaks down the cell wall of bacteria.
  - Interleukin-1 (Il-1): Induces fever and the production of acute phase proteins, some of which are antimicrobial because they can opsonize bacteria.

### Acquired/Adaptive/Specific Immunity
- **3<sup>rd</sup>** line of defense:
  - Immunological memory allows the organism to remember the previous encounter with the pathogen for a quicker and more   efficient defense against the pathogen a second time
  - Slower than innate immune response, but long-lasting
  - Main components:
    - B lymphocytes (B-cells)
    - T lymphocytes (T-cells)
    - Antigen presenting cells (APCs)

### Cells of the Immune System
- Leucocytes (white blood cells/immune cells arising from bone marrow, found in blood and lymph):
  - Granulocytes (irregularly shaped nuclei with 2-5 lobes):
    - Basophils: Roles in inflammation and allergic response
    - Eosinophils: Motile phagocytic cells capable of leaving the bloodstream and going into tissue to fight protozoan and helminthic parasites
    - Neutrophils: Most abundant leukocytes in blood (50-70%), also called polymorphonuclear (PMN) neutrophils. Active phagocytic cells, the first cells to migrate to the site of infection, but do not provide prolonged defense as they last only a few days
  - Agranulocytes (one-lobed nucleus, mononuclear leucocytes):
    - Monocytes: Largest type of leucocytes. Circulate in blood, and migrate into tissues where they differentiate into macrophages that become resident cells in the tissues (long-lived large white blood cells that engulf microbes)
      - Free macrophages: Motile and gather at site of infection/inflammation
      - Fixed macrophages: Resident at specific tissues
    - Lymphocytes: Main type of cells found in lymph
      - Large: Natural Killer Lymphocyte (NK cell): Attack and kill infected or cancerous body cells by secreting toxins onto their surfaces
      - Small (smallest leucocytes): B and T Lymphocytes (B and T cells)
        - B cells: Display B cell receptors (BCR), mature in bone marrow and circulate in blood, mature activated B cell is a plasma cell which produces and secretes antibodies
        - T cells: Display T cell receptors (TCR), mature in the thymus
  - Mast cells: Similar to Basphils in appearance and function. Found in tissue with a role inflammation and allergic response.
  - Dendritic cells: Star shaped phagocytes in skin and mucous membranes that perform antigen capture and antigen presentation in adaptive immunity

B-cell receptors and antibodies are both types of immunoglobulins. The difference is one is membrane bound and the other is secreted

### Human Immunoglobulin Hierarchy

**[1]** Immunoglobulin *Classes*/*Isotypes* (heavy constant region sequence classifications):
- IgG (γ):
  - 70-85% of Ig in serum
  - Monomer
  - Most versatile Ig capable of carrying out all of the functions of immunoglobulin molecules
  - *Subclasses*/*Subtypes* (smaller differences in heavy constant region sequences):
    - IgG1 - γ1 heavy chains
    - IgG2 - γ2 heavy chains
    - IgG3 - γ3 heavy chains
    - IgG4 - γ4 heavy chains
- IgA (α):
  - 5-15% of Ig in serum
  - Monomer in serum, dimer in secretions
  - Major class of Ig in secretions - tears, saliva, colostrum, mucus
  - *Subclasses*/*Subtypes* (smaller differences in heavy constant region sequences):
    - IgA1 - α1 heavy chains
    - IgA2 - α2 heavy chains
- IgM (μ):
  - 5-10% of Ig in serum
  - Normally a pentamer, but can also exist as a monomer
  - Good at clumping microorganisms together for eventual elimination from the body
- IgD (δ):
  - <1% of Ig in serum
  - Monomer
  - It's role in serum uncertain
- IgE (ε):
  - ~0% of Ig in serum
  - Monomer with extra constant region domain
  - Binds very tightly to Fc receptors and is involved in allergic reactions

**[2]** Immunoglobulin *Types* (light constant region sequence classifications):
- Kappa (κ) light chain (60% of Ig in serum)
- Lambda (λ) light chain (40% of Ig in serum)
  - *Subtypes*: λ<sub>1</sub>, λ<sub>2</sub>, λ<sub>3</sub>, λ<sub>4</sub>

**[3]** IMGT *Groups* (V(D)J genes of heavy and light chains, further divided into *Subgroups* of genes sharing at least 75% identity at the nucleotide level)
- Heavy chain (VDJ):
  - V-genes (*Subgroups*: IGHV1-IGHV8)
  - D-genes (*Subgroups*: IGHD1-IGHD7)
  - J-genes (*Subgroups*: IGHJ1-IGHJ6)
- Light chain (VJ):
  - V-genes (*Subgroups*: IGKV1-IGKV7, IGLV1-IGLV9)
  - J-genes: (*Subgroups*: IGKJ1-IGKJ5, IGLJ1-IGLJ7)

**[4]** IMGT *Genes* and *Alleles*
- *Genes*: DNA sequence that can be potentially transcribed and/or translated
- *Alleles*: Polymorphic mutant variants of a *Gene*, with *01 designated as the reference sequence
- Full nomenclature: IG<*Chain*><*Group*><*Subgroup*>-<*Gene*>*<*Alleles*>

### Cytokines
Protein or glycoproteins (<30 kDa) that may be soluble or membrane bound
Small soluble molecules that act as intercellular mediators. They bind to cytokine receptors on the surface of other receptors
- Autocrine signaling: 
- Short half-life (mostly act over a short-distance)
- Types of cytokines:
  - Interleukins: Cytokines produced by leukocyte acting on another leucocyte (though cells other than leukocytes can use interleukins).
  - Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF): Produced by mast cells, macrophages, and T cells. Often firmly anchored to the membrane. Responsible for apoptosis of many cell types. TNFα is released by macrophages to activate neutrophils by binding their cytokine receptors.
  - Interferons (interfere with viral replication):
    - When a cell gets infected by a virus, it sends a distress signal (interferons) that stimulate uninfected cells to produce anti-viral proteins to suppress the spread of the viral infection.
    - Type I: IFN-α, IFN-β (produced in response to viral infection)
    - Type II: IFN-γ (increases phagocytosis by macrophages)
  - Colony-Stimulating Factors (CSF): Essential for the growth and differentiation of immature leukocytes in the bone marrow (red blood cells, monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes). It ensures the body is supplied with sufficient supplies of white blood cells of all types
  - Chemokines: Act as chemo-attractants and signal leucocytes to move. For example, they may be released at the site of infection to signal neutrophils to come and become the principle phagocytic cell at the site of infection.
