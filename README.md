Notes on how the human immune system works

*Reference: https://www.microbiologybook.org/*

### Introduction
Immunology is the study of our protection from foreign macromolecules or invading organisms and our responses to them. These invaders include viruses, bacteria, protozoa or even larger parasites. In addition, we develop immune responses against our own proteins (and other molecules) in autoimmunity and against our own aberrant cells in tumor immunity. The main function and challenge of the immune system is properly discriminating between what is self and foreign.

### Innate or non-specific immunity
The innate immune system is our first line of defense against invading organisms:
- Skin: The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier nearly impermeable to most infectious agents. Desquamation (skin peeling) also helps remove adhered bacteria and other infectious agents.
- Tears, saliva, sweat: Liquid flushing helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth. Contain enzymes and anti-microbial peptides that inhibit bacterial growth.
- Mucus: Lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract helps protect the lungs and digestive systems from infection
